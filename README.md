### Controls: 

Arrow Keys to move

R to reset the game

### Running:
This program uses ncurses, and I've only tested it on my Mac's terminal. Here's the command I use to run it:

```shell
make
```
Then to run the program
```shell
./2048
```
OR install the program after building and run it.
```shell
make install
2048
```
